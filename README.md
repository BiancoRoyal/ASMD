# OPC UA Address Space Model Designer (ASMD)

OPC Unified Architecture (UA) is the next generation of OPC. One of the biggest improvements in OPC UA is a powerful Address Space and Information Model. OPC UA allows for the presentation of a real-time process and underlying infrastructure as a consistent information model built up with nodes. The process model is represented by nodes, attributes and their mutual relationships. Therefore, this powerful concept allows us to present in UA not only raw process data, but also complete information about the process state and process environment. The flexibility of UA ensures that there is no existing or future system that is too complicated to be exposed via UA. Of course, such flexibility leads to complications during configuration, that’s why OPC UA Address Space Model Designer (ASMD) has been born.

Concluding, Address Space Model Designer (ASMD) is a user-friendly tool supporting all aspects of the model designing process.

## Releases

The ASMD was written by CAS Lodz Poland. I am the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source.

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [releases on this repository](https://github.com/mpostol/ASMD/releases). For your convenience, the versions of the repository, tools and NuGet packages has been listed in the next subsections.
